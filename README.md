# Welcome 
I'm Lupin, a high school graduate with focus on computer science and a strong interest in cybersecurity. I am an active learner currently working on building toward a professional career in cybersecurity. This Github profile is my personal workspace where I document what I learn, build tools, and track my progress through hands-on learning.

My current learning goals are focused in building strong foundational skills in cybersecurity, which includes programming (primarily in Python), penetration testing, system vulnerabilities assessment and more. Furthermore, I am also learning how to document my work and build an interactive portfolio to showcase my projects and progress
  
My learning is currently centered around cybersecurity fundamentals, especially through Pico ctf challenges, which will help understand real world concepts in a 'do your own research' way. I'm also developing my skills in Python, trying to create a beginner friendly project like password analyzer to better understand automation and security logic. Alongside that, I'm also learning how to write documentations and manage my projects using Github workflows.

Some of the key repositories on this profile include 'pico-ctf', where i write detailed notes and explanations for each challenge I complete; 'password analyzer', which is Python-based project focused on evaluating password strength and 'python basics', which contains basic experiments practice scripts of my programming journey.

My current goals are to continue building beginner-friendly tools, improve my understanding of system and web vulnerabilities, and use GitHub as a long-term portfolio to track and reflect on my growth in the field. I'm committed to learning through action and documenting every step clearly for others and for my future self.


The galaxy is vast, and allies are always welcome. If you’re crafting beginner-friendly cybersecurity tools, decoding CTF challenges, or exploring the learning path, reach out or grab a copy of my code. Together, we’ll conquer the digital frontier. May the Force guide our hacking adventures.
