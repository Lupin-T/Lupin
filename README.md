# Welcome 
I'm Lupin, a high school graduate with focus on computer science and a strong interest in cybersecurity. I’m currently focused on learning Python, Git, Linux, and Markdown while exploring Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges and security vulnerabilities. This Github profile is my personal workspace where I document what I learn, build tools, and track my progress through hands-on learning.
  
My learning is currently centered around cybersecurity fundamentals, especially through Pico ctf challenges, which will help understand real world concepts in a 'do your own research' way. I'm also developing my skills in Python, trying to create a beginner-friendly project like password analyzer to better understand automation and security logic. Alongside that, I'm learning how to write a professional documentation and manage my projects using Github workflows.

Some of the key repositories on this profile include 'pico-ctf', where i write detailed notes and explanations for each challenge I complete; 'password analyzer', which is Python-based project focused on evaluating password strength; and 'python basics', which contains basic experiments practice scripts of my programming journey.

My current goals are to continue building beginner-friendly tools, improve my understanding of system and web vulnerabilities, and use GitHub as a long-term portfolio to track and reflect on my growth in the field. I'm committed to learning through action and documenting every step clearly for others — and for my future self.

I’m open to collaboration and feedback. If you’re working on beginner-friendly cybersecurity tools, CTF writeups, or other learning-focused projects, feel free to reach out or fork one of my repositories.

The galaxy is vast, and allies are always welcome. If you’re crafting beginner-friendly cybersecurity tools, decoding CTF challenges, or exploring the learning path, reach out or grab a copy of my code. Together, we’ll conquer the digital frontier — may the Force guide our hacking adventures.
